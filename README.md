# DiffusionIQT
Introducing a 3D conditional diffusion model for image quality transfer! <br /> 

**Image quality transfer (IQT)** is a ML framework to enhance low-quality medical data, originally proposed by **[Alexander et al. 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811917302008)**. <br />
Inspired from a recent development of diffusion models, we propose a 3D conditional diffusion model for image quality transfer. <br />
To the best of our knowledge, this is the **first work to apply a diffusion model for 3D medical image enhancement**, especially using patch-based method. <br />

Code still under developement, please wait :)
